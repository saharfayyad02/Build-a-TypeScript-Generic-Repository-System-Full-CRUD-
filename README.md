# 🧩 TypeScript Generic Repository System (CRUD)

This project demonstrates a **Generic Repository Pattern** in **TypeScript**, built to manage in-memory static data for common models like `User`, `Course`, and `Booking`. It includes full **CRUD** functionality and leverages **TypeScript generics**, **interfaces**, and **inheritance** for type-safe, reusable design.
